# Calki
A simple calculator that is capable of performing simple mathematical functions. My main goal from this project is to apply my knowledge to create a good native android UI


PS: I know that the name "Calki" is realy cheesy and the style is overused! But you know it's silly when you spend around 30 minuts thinking of a name for a project that will be just for learning ;)
You know what? I don't blame you for being bothered by the name's concept, I blame those lazy entrepreneurs for naming every product they claim that it will revolutionize the industry ... Why are you still reading this?!! GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE..
